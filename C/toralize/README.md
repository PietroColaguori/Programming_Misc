This project's code at the moment is identical to the one explained in [this programming video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stUnezUHs9g), it is honestly a great video, shoutout to the author for explaining so well and showcasing the code. I simply followed the video along and decided to save the obtained code in a file.

I plan on adding a DNS resolution functionality and maybe other changes that I may think about, as suggested by the author himself.
